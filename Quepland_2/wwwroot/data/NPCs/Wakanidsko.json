Created things by nature are known by their creator, but a thing that grows from itself can be truly unknown. I have used magic to produce a variety of things, including my library, which grows its own books. The other side of the library is a safe room, which grows its own safes. The safes in that room are connected to the books in the library, and the keys in one can open the safes in the other.",
